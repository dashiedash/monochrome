                    B&W knows the right book I need, when I need it, and how I
                    want it. All in one library. It's like magic.

                    I don't need to go to another bookstore. I know B&W has the
                    book that I want. My only regret is that I didn't buy it
                    from them.

                    Who needs libraries when you have B&W? Cheap books, whenever
                    and wherever you want them. All it takes is a search on
                    their website.
